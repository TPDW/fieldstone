\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Philosophy} %------------------------------------------------------
This document was writing with my students in mind, i.e. 3rd and 4th year 
Geology/Geophysics students at Utrecht University. 
I have chosen to use jargon as little as possible unless it is a term that is 
commonly found in the geodynamics literature (methods paper as well as 
application papers). There is no mathematical proof of any theorem or statement 
I make. These are to be found in generic Numerical Analysic, Finite Element and 
Linear Algebra books. 

The codes I provide here are by no means optimised as I value code readability 
over code efficiency. I have also chosen to avoid resorting to multiple code 
files or even functions to favour a sequential reading of the codes. 
These codes are not designed to form the basis of a real life application:
Existing open source highly optimised codes shoud be preferred, such as ASPECT, 
CITCOM, LAMEM, PTATIN, PYLITH, ... 

All kinds of feedback is welcome on the text (grammar, typos, ...) or on the 
code(s). You will have my eternal gratitude if you wish to contribute an 
example, a benchmark, a cookbook. 

All the python scripts and this document are freely available at 
\begin{center}

\end{center}

\subsection{Acknowledgments} %-------------------------------------------------

I have benefitted from many discussions, lectures, tutorials, coffee machine 
discussions, debugging sessions, conference poster sessions, etc ... 
over the years. I wish to name these instrumental people in particular and 
in alphabetic order: 
Wolfgang Bangerth, 
Jean Braun, 
Philippe Fullsack, 
Menno Fraters, 
Anne Glerum,
Timo Heister,
Robert Myhill,
John Naliboff,
Lukas van de Wiel,
Arie van den Berg, and the whole ASPECT family/team. 

I wish to acknowledge many BSc and MSc students for their questions and feedback.
and wish to mention Job Mos in particular who wrote the
very first version of fieldstone as part of his MSc thesis.
and Tom Weir for his contributions to the compressible formulations.
