This is just going to be a .txt file detailing which fieldstone is which
01 - donea and huerta full pressure
02 - other benchmark that doesn't work
03 - also donea and huerta, unclear if different from 01
04 - sinking ball
05 - d&h penalty
06 - cbf zhong
07 - cbf zhong - sides separated 
08 - attempted own benchmark
09 - cbf on prescribed velocity field
10 - penalty method zhong convergence
11 - ful zhong convergence
12 - d&h penalty - internal nodal derivatives
13 - d&h full convergence
14 - d&h penalty convergence
15 - convection in a box
16 - temperature cbf w/ prescibed temp
17 - traction cbf w/ prescribe velocity/pressure
18 - temp cbf w/ temp solve
19 - annulus cbf tractions
20 - annulus cbf tractions convergence
